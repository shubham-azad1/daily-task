Task done 
Interfacing of EEPROM chips with PIC24 studied and code written.
In depth study of UART and ADC peripherals.
Struggling in doing simulation stuff on Proteus.
 
Outcome
The fear of dealing with numerous registers in pic has gone away since the compiler XC16 has inbuilt library for various peripherals including ADC, I2C, SPI,etc.
Have found many useful links which will be helpful while dealing PIC24 family.

Future Work
Implementation of codes on the kit. (The kit should be provided to the team at its earliest; sooner the better)
