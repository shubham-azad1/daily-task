Read CoDR (OBDH dated 30/07/2014)thoroughly.

OUTCOME

Having read CoDR I feel I was comfortable with topics such 
as spi, i2c, memory and its types.

Need to understand topics like virtual memory, 
timer,processor (RISC in particular as we are using 
it),memory management.

Haven't read software portion properly.
